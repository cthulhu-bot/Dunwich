Fix RFuncs to read from config file.\r\n2. Build backdoor for testing straight R code. (DONE)\r\n3. Possibly refactor the RVector generation back to using a Factory in order to abstract away the initalization function which is needed to programatically retain the C# RVector name as the vector's actual name in R. (LAME IDEA COMPLETED IN A DIFFERNT WAY)\r\n4. Fix the RVector enumeration and add indexing (DONE)\r\n5. Abstract out RFile access (writing/reading) since it will need to be accessed by more than just the functions class.  RVector currently having difficult time writing to Rfile without additional layer of abstraction.","google":"","name":"Dunwich","tagline":""}
